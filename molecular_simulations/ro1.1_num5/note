gcc -o MDT.exe MDT.c -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas was used to compile it.

The cutoff radius was chosen as 3.5.

The first simulation was with rho 1.1 and T (both ones) as 1, expecting a solid!

I've created 3 files. MDT.sh gdr.sh and traiettoria.sh, so I can edit those quickly with vim and run with bash example.sh 

The simulations have been visualized on VMD, as VDW opaque with sphere size 0.1 and resolution 15.
Movie are generated with default option MPEG-1 and the frames are keeped! as both rock and roll (xy lemniscate) (rotation) and trajectory (trajectory)
Always remember to put (reset view before filming!
)
I'm thinking about making other simulations with the same parameters so I can feed different frames from different simulations into my neural network!
