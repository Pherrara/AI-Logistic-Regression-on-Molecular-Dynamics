gcc -o MDT.exe MDT.c -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas was used to compile it.

The cutoff radius was chosen as 3.5.

The first simulation was with rho 1.1 and T (both ones) as 1, expecting a solid!

I've created 3 files. MDT.sh gdr.sh and traiettoria.sh, so I can edit those quickly with vim and run with bash example.sh
